Abstract

We propose AetherChain, a decentralized operating system (dOS) that extends the
principles of peer-to-peer electronic cash systems to the realm of computation and data
sovereignty. Traditional operating systems rely on centralized kernels and trusted
intermediaries for resource allocation, process execution, and data integrity, creating
single points of failure vulnerable to censorship, surveillance, and compromise.
AetherChain achieves a distributed, tamper-evident runtime where users control their
computational flows through cryptographic proofs, without reliance on a monolithic
authority.

AetherChain captures user commands—processes, memory allocations, and data
exchanges—as timestamped transactions on a probabilistic blockchain, executed via
consensus among user nodes. Integrity is enforced through a novel "Proof-of-Compute"
(PoC) mechanism, where nodes compete to solve resource-constrained puzzles tied to
Extropic thermodynamic sampling for energy-efficient verification. This ensures
liveness and safety in a "kernel without kernel" architecture, treating human data as
sacred, monetizable essence.

The system is secured by exponential probability decay against adversarial chains,
drawing from elliptic curve cryptography and hash-based commitments. It includes
built-in support for digital currency wallets to facilitate payments for contributing
compute and storage, fostering a self-sustaining ecosystem where data flows are
empowered, not extracted. We demonstrate through mathematical modeling that
AetherChain resists double-execution attacks with overwhelming probability, enabling a
truly sovereign digital habitat.

   1.​ Introduction

Centralized operating systems, from Unix derivatives to mobile kernels, abstract
hardware complexity but at the cost of user agency. Commands are executed locally or
via cloud intermediaries, with no immutable record of intent or outcome. This opacity
enables exploits: buffer overflows in kernels, unverified updates, and commodified data
trails.
Bitcoin's innovation—a chain of hashed blocks secured by proof-of-work—solved
double-spending in currency by creating an immutable ledger of value transfers. We
generalize this to computation: an operating system where every process is a verifiable
transaction, chained immutably across a network of user devices. No central server; no
privileged kernel. Instead, a weave of emulated exchanges, probabilistically validated.

AetherChain builds on tufureOS's vision of a "secure, sleek, self-aware" runtime,
integrating Extropic's TSUs for hardware-accelerated anomaly detection. It monetizes
sacred human data through user-staked relays, echoing Bitcoin's miner incentives but
for computational labor, with built-in digital currency wallet support for seamless
transactions. This whitepaper outlines the protocol, mathematics, and security,
